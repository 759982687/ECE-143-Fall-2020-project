# ECE-143-Fall-2020-project


In order to run old_data.py, you need to make sure that you have the following installed:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- PyPlot 
- Emoji

All four of these can be installed easily by using pip 
old_data.py is already set up to run and generate the plots used in the presentation. You might need to edit the path the data for the plots. Another thing is, to get the emoji's to appear on the plot, you will need to point to the font file. Furthermore, some of data files are too large to upload to github, so they have been included as a zip. You will need to extract them to run as well. If you want to see some of the various different plots that were cut from the presentation the code can be uncommented.
